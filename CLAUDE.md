## Project status (Guppy)

This project publishes its status to Guppy, Nilo's project manager (https://github.com/manuelstone/guppy). Everything Guppy-related lives in `guppy/`, written in English:

- `guppy/STATUS.md`: extended status and work log, for agents working on this project. It is never synced anywhere.
- `guppy/STATUS.json`: public summary, following the status contract (https://github.com/manuelstone/guppy/blob/main/docs/status-contract.md). `.github/workflows/guppy-sync.yml` copies it to Guppy every time it changes on the default branch, and from there it goes to a public website. Never put private information, credentials or secrets in it.

At the end of every work session on the project, even if `status` stays the same:

1. Update the Status section of `guppy/STATUS.md` and add a brief entry at the top of its Log.
2. Update `guppy/STATUS.json`: change `status` if it changed, rewrite `status_text` so it says where the project stands now, and always take new `last_update` and `last_update_unix`. They record when the status was last reported, not when `status` last changed: an `active` project gets new dates after every session. Take both dates from a single timestamp: `ts=$(date +%s); date -d "@$ts" '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z'; echo "$ts"` (GNU date; the contract has the macOS and PowerShell versions).
3. Commit both files with the rest of the session's changes and push to the default branch.

Statuses: `active` (being worked on), `blocked` (waiting for something outside the project), `inactive` (stopped by choice), `planned` (decided, not started), `archived` (closed).

`status_text`: one or two sentences, under 200 characters, plain text. Say where the project stands and what comes next; if blocked, start with what it is waiting for and from whom. Self-contained: no relative dates, name versions and third parties. Rewrite it in full each time; the history goes in the Log.

When Nilo asks to change this project's data in Guppy (its icon, title, description or status), edit `guppy/STATUS.json` following the contract, commit and push to the default branch: the sync publishes it. A change of only the icon, title or description does not touch the dates. `icon` is any public URL, ideally a square 128×128 PNG. Never edit the Guppy repo for this.

Do not use CHANGELOG.md for this: it is for users. Do not edit `guppy-sync.yml`. If the Guppy sync action fails, read its log in the Actions tab and tell Nilo.
